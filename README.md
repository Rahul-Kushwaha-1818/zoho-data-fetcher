# Zoho Creator & MongoDB Integration

This project demonstrates the integration between Zoho Creator and a MongoDB database using Zoho's API. The aim is to fetch data from Zoho, handle OAuth tokens for authentication, and sync this data with a MongoDB database. Additionally, it allows for CRUD operations through APIs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoho-mongodb-integration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd zoho-mongodb-integration
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setup

Follow these steps to configure the project:

1. **Read the Zoho Creator Documentation**  
   The project follows Zoho's API v2.1 guidelines. Refer to [Zoho Creator API Documentation](https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/api/v2.1/) for more information.
   
2. **Obtain Client ID and Client Secret**  
   You'll need to get your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Code for Scope` from Zoho Creator.

3. **Generate Access and Refresh Tokens**  
   Use the following API to generate the `access_token` and `refresh_token`:
   ```bash
   https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token?grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&code=YOUR_CODE
   ```

4. **Refresh Access Token**  
   Zoho's access token expires after one hour, so the following API is used to generate a new token using the `refresh_token`:
   ```bash
   https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token?refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

## Zoho API Integration

### OAuth Token Generation

To connect to Zoho, the project uses Zoho's OAuth 2.0 protocol. Start by generating a `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Scope` from Zoho Creator. After that, you can create the access and refresh tokens, which are essential for making API calls to Zoho's platform.

### Access Token Refresh

The access token expires after 1 hour, and the refresh token is used to generate a new access token without requiring re-authentication. Here's how you can refresh it:
```bash
https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token?refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

## CRUD Operations

Once connected, the project can perform various operations such as fetching reports, deleting records, creating new records, and updating existing ones.

- **Fetch all reports:**
  ```bash
  https://creator.zoho.in/api/v2/dev_it/my-first-project/reports
  ```

- **Fetch specific data:**
  ```bash
  https://creator.zoho.in/api/v2.1/dev_it/my-first-project/report/All_Leave_Requests
  ```

- **Delete a record:**
  ```bash
  https://creator.zoho.in/api/v2/dev_it/my-first-project/report/All_Leave_Requests/{ID}
  ```

- **Create a new record:**
  ```bash
  https://creator.zoho.in/api/v2/dev_it/my-first-project/form/All_Leave_Requests
  ```

- **Update an existing record:**
  ```bash
  https://creator.zoho.in/api/v2/dev_it/my-first-project/report/All_Leave_Requests/210184000000023007
  ```

## MongoDB Connection

After setting up Zoho's API, the next step is connecting the fetched data to MongoDB. The MongoDB model is created in VS Code, and the project handles the connection to the database.

1. **Database Configuration:**  
   Set up your MongoDB connection by creating a `.env` file with the database URL and credentials.

2. **Connecting to MongoDB:**  
   The project establishes a connection to MongoDB to store the data fetched from Zoho.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure you have MongoDB running locally or provide the connection string for a remote instance in your `.env` file.
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
